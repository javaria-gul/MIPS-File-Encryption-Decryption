# MIPS-File-Encryption-Decryption
This project implements a File Encryption and Decryption System using MIPS Assembly Language. It provides functionalities for converting text files into binary format, encrypting and decrypting files using XOR-based encryption with a user-defined key, and performing brute force decryption attempts.
